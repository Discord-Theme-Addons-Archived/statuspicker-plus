# v1.0.2
Multiple really needed fixes.
- If you're using the Game Activity Toggle plugin and have it where it displays on the status list, it should no longer break the entire thing. I couldn't really find out a proper way to fix this- this entire thing is scuffed to begin with so I just put it in the top left part of the menu.
- Fixed the position issue for the placeholder avatar. You can also customize that now if you'd like!

# v1.0.1
Make the custom status placeholder text reappear cause it looks ugly when blank.

# v1.0.0
Initial creation, welcome!
